/*@Purpose : Ability to find frequency of words in a large paragraph phrase “Paranoids are not
 * paranoid because they are paranoid but because they keep putting themselves deliberately into paranoid avoidable situations”
 * - Use hashcode to find index of the words in the para
 * - Create LinkedList for each index and store the words and its frequency
 * - Use LinkedList to do the Hash Table Operation
 * - To do this create MyMapNode with Key Value Pair and create LinkedList of MyMapNode
